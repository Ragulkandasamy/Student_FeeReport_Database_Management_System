PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
  Student fees report is computer software in made with java to help schools and universities to maintain their student fee details. The highest privilege or power is given to the admin. So the admin is the institutional head who can add accountants and maintain their details. The accountants are the one who maintains the student fees record. Each accountant has his set of student details to look after. For example, in a university an accountant look after the student fee record of a whole department. Such we can find if the person paid his fee or not.  	    
	We can also view the student’s personal details such as email id, course, contact number, address and roll Number. Since most data are stored manually it is very difficult to store and search for data when needed, so we automate this process by using the student fee report software. It has the power to store more than 500 student records. The main highlight of this software is that it doesn’t require internet for performing its operation.
